# Hello-World
My First Repository! Yipee!!!
As a child I had dreams to change the world!
Now I am 45 years old and I havn't stopped believing it would happen.
So I wake up every day with a heart of Gratitude and a mind of Expectation.
I live each day likes its my last giving my very best all the time. Success is deliberate.
I put my trust in God and not in the World. To trust in the world is like to build on sand MC Ebo says...
I sorround myself with positive people and good memories of conquests keep me going to the next.
I love like its the first time and I express myself explicitly. There are no middle lines in Middlesex and Kate Middleton would expect nothin else from a Prince.
I like the movie Pay It Forward and I genuinely think start a revolution in our mind. Yes we can sieze power and bring it to the Youth.
